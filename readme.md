Word Guessing Game

This is a word guessing game where the player tries to guess a random word by entering letters one at a time. The player has 60 seconds to guess the word, and for every incorrect guess, the number of remaining guesses decreases by one. If the player guesses the word within the allotted time and number of guesses, they win the game. Otherwise, they lose the game.
